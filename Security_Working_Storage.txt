gsutil command line working with cloudstorage bucket

Cloud storage security concepts, cloud storage access is as "locked down" or "wide open" options

Access Management Priciples 
Two Methods: IAM and ACL

Security via IAM
Granted at Projected, resources or individual bucket (but cannot be on the objects)
possible to grant access to manage bucket but not view/read objects inside.

IAM Roles:
primitive project levels roles (owner/editor/viewer)
Standard storage Role (work independelty from ACLs)
Storage Admin
Storage Object Admin
Storage Object Creator
Storage Object viewer

ACLs: 

Signed URL: timed access to object data
set a timer on access to bucket or object
useful for temporarily giving access without need of signing 

Customer-supplied encryption keys:

default encryption using google supplied keys, but we can use customer supplied keys
using a .boto configuration file used for customer supplied encryption keys

Best Practices using Storage 
always IAM roles, ACL's or Signed URL'security
Remove application access when no longer needed
Dont make bucket names a target (like gs://customer-ssn-no)
check default obj ACL before adding objects
publically writable buckets are a bad idea
use signed URLs for secure access without need of google account for login
